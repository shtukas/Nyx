There are two objects in the Nyx hierarchy
    1. NxQuarks (data carriers)
    2. NxListings
Collectively referred to as NxEntity

A NxListing can contain NxListings and NxQuarks
A NxEntity may be `related` to any other NxEntity

A Nx1323 is either
    ["NxQuark", id]
    ["NxListing", id , Nx21]

It was introduced to be the return value of NxEntities::getNxEntityByIdOrNull(id)
