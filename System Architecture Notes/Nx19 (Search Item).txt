    Nx19
        {
            "announce" : String
            "type"     : "NxListing"
            "payload"  : NxListing
        }
        {
            "announce" : String
            "type"     : "Nx27"
            "payload"  : Nx27
        }
        {
            "announce" : String
            "type"     : "GalaxyLocation"
            "payload"  : String, FS Location
        }

Go
    Nx19 
        {
            "announce" : String
            "uuid"     : String # uuid of the NxEntity
        }

The reason why there is a difference in the Ruby version and the Go version is that the Ruby version is essentially a JSON object. I would have given the same shape to the Go version if Go had nice support for union types.
