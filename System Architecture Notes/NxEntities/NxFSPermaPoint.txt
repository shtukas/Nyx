NxFSPermaPoints are trying to maintain a reference to files and folders on the file system which may move, be renamed, or be edited. We associate them with NxSmartPoints (elements of a Smart Directory), the NxSmartPoint and its correspnding NxFSPermaPoint have the same `uuid`.

NxFSPermaPoints {
    "uuid"           : String
    "type"           : "directory"
    "location"       : String
    "NxSD1-3945d937" : String <- what to look for on the file system to find it
}

NxFSPermaPoints {
    "uuid"           : String
    "type"           : "file"
    "location"       : String
    "inode"          : Integer
    "SHA256"         : String
}
