smartdirectories1.sqlite3

CREATE TABLE _smartdirectories1_ (_uuid_ text, _datetime_ text, _description_ text, _importId_ text);

The _description_ is the filename at scan time. We cache it here for faster retrieval when building the dataset for search.

The _importId_ is used by the routine that import smartfolders from disk for garbage collection.

On the ground, smart directories are recognised by the fact that their name ends with '[s]'

They are automatically given a file ".NxSD1-3945d937" containing a UUID, the one used for registration in the database table.

NxSmartDirectory {
    "uuid"        : String # The uuid is stored inside the .NxSD1-3945d937 in the directory.
    "entityType"  : "NxSmartDirectory"
    "datetime"    : DateTime Iso 8601 UTC Zulu
    "description" : String
}

NxDirectory2

nx-directories-v2.sqlite3
create table _directories_ (_directoryId_ text);

The directory id is a unique string that is part of the name of a string. In fact NxDirectory2s are unique string referred directories of the file system with content highlights. 

{
    "uuid"        : String
    "entityType"  : "NxDirectory2"
    "datetime"    : DateTime Iso 8601 UTC Zulu

    "description" : String
}
