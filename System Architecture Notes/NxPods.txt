NxPods exists as folders on the file system.

The folder name is the nxpod uuid (which has to be a uuid, not any random string)

Each folder then has the following files
    - uuid.txt        : which contains the uuid of the nxpod
    - unixtime.txt    : the associated unixtime
    - description.txt : The description
    - type.txt        : which contains the type "Line" | "Url" | "Text" | "UniqueFileClickable" | "FSLocation" | "FSUniqueString"
    - manifest.txt    : which, depending on the type, contains
        - "Line"                : (empty) (the entire content is the description)
        - "Url"                 : The url
        - "Text"                : The file name of the text file (which is in the same folder)
        - "UniqueFileClickable" : The filename of the clikable file (which is in the same folder)
        - "FSLocation"          : The foldername of the directory (which is in the same folder)
        - "FSUniqueString"      : The unique string
    - links.json      : Array of Space Ids (JSON generated)
