There is fundamentally no restriction on theunique string referred to by `FSUniqueString` or `NxSmartDirectory`

We have restrictions on the contents of a smart directory

- The contents of the directory itself must all carry a unique string in their name.

- The unique string must all be within square brackets. Ex: "Subjects (Academic) [1f8c1734-a79b]"

- The square brackets are not part of the unique string, the just surround it.

- There must not be another occurence of '[' or ']' other than the ones surrounding the unique string.

- The enclosed unique string should be the last element of the file name. Ex: "Subjects (Academic) [1f8c1734-a79b]"
