Some Neired Entities are going to be represented as folders on the file system.

The folder name is the quark uuid (which has to be a uuid, not any random string)

Each folder then has the following files
    - uuid.txt        : which contains the uuid of the quark
    - description.txt : The description
    - type.txt        : which contains the type "Line" | "Url" | "Text" | "UniqueFileClickable" | "FSLocation" | "FSUniqueString"
    - manifest.txt     : which, depending on the type, contains
        - The line 
        - The url
        - The file name of the text file (which is in the same folder)
        - The filename of the clikable file (which is in the same folder)
        - The foldername of the directory (which is in the same folder)
        - The unique string
