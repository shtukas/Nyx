Attribute files are text files used as both key value stores and key/array stores. For instance the following file

------------------------
id: 123456789
name: Pascal
place: London
place: New York
------------------------ 

Indicates values for the `id` and the `name` and to values for `place`. 

For instance `getOrNull("id")` would return "123456789" whereas `getArray("place")` returns `["London", "New York"]`.

Note that the fact that `place` is an array of values is not a property of the attribute in the file itself, but known by the thing querying the file. To illustrate that, in the following file, for instance, 

------------------------
id: 123456789
name: Pascal
place: London
------------------------ 

... it is not immediately apparent that `place` is an array. When an attribute is known to be an array, then `getArray(attributeName)` allays return an array, possibly empty. In the case of `getOrNull(attributeName)` we return null if the value is missing. If the value is mandatory call `getMandatory(attributeName)` and in this last case a missing value results in an error.

Missing files are automaticaly created when setting values against them. Querying a missing file results in null values or emty arrays.

Values can be empty. Example:

------------------------
message: 
------------------------ 

.. to represent an empty message.
