The two elements of the Nyx Network (aka Space) are NxPods (data carriers) and NxNav (navigation nodes).

They all have unique Ids which follow a well defined schema.

Nyx Space ids have the schema: "<p1>-<p2>" (example: "183455452046-01")

p1: a 12-long string of digits
p2: 
    "01" for NxPods
    "02" for NxNavs

Nyx Space ids have therefore length 15.
