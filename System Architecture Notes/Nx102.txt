Nx102 is a library that manages the creation, access, edition and transmuation of [description, contentType, payload] arrays

Those array can then be stored in objects that are interested in those type of contents.

Quark was the first type to ue them:

- contentType : "Line" | "Url" | "Text" | "ClickableType" | "AionPoint"
- payload
    [contentType]     -> [payload]
    "Line"            -> "" # empty string, the description is the payload
    "Url"             -> String
    "Text"            -> String # reference to a blob
    "ClickableType"   -> <nhash>|<dottedExtension>
    "AionPoint"       -> <nhash>
